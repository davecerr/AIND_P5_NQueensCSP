Tackled the N-Queens Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) using symbolic constraints (with SymPy) in a Jupyter notebook, and solved it using the Backtracking Search algorithm from AIMA.

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Constraint_Satisfaction.ipynb
